Q - 2 Find the third smallest distinct number:

function findThirdSmallest(arr) { let min = Infinity; let secondMin = Infinity; let thirdMin = Infinity;

for (let num of arr) { if (num < min) { thirdMin = secondMin; secondMin = min; min = num; } else if (num > min && num < secondMin) { thirdMin = secondMin; secondMin = num; } else if (num > secondMin && num < thirdMin) { thirdMin = num; } }

return thirdMin !== Infinity ? thirdMin : null; }

console.log(findThirdSmallest([5, 1, 2, 1, 3])); // Output: 3

explaination - What's happening here: We track the smallest, second smallest, and third smallest distinct numbers.

We make sure not to treat duplicates as different values.

The conditions:

num < min → shift all three values down.

num > min && num < secondMin → shift secondMin to thirdMin.

num > secondMin && num < thirdMin → update thirdMin.
